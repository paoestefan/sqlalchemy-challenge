# sqlalchemy-challenge
## Challenge for bootcamp
------------------------------------
First step, clone the repository
I had some issues with my internet connection while doing this hw so I have made it in just one move. 
Sorry if I dont make so many uploads to the github repository.

Very challenging tasks to complete. I gotta say I do not know how I ended solving the flask part & I could not run it in the jupyter notebook or in the app.py file.
